# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sleeptil3
## aka Shawn Clary
- Iâ€™m interested in ... a lot of things, too many things. But mostly focused on learning as much as I can so I can send stuff and people to space.
- Iâ€™m currently learning ... full-stack development. HTML, CSS, JS, and React in the books, and making quick work of the back end with Django and Node.JS with MongoDB.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... anything that makes me learn something new, or get better at something old.

ðŸ“«  How to reach me ... [sleeptil3software@gmail.com](mailto:sleeptil3software@gmail.com)

-Shawn
